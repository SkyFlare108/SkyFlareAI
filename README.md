# Project Description
I am working on a simple Python Artificially Intelligent ChatBot project to take standard user input from the user, store it to a "knowledge base" (in this project a txt file), and ensure no case or type sensitive issues cause faulty output results from it. Additionally each user can create their oen personalized knowledge base to access answers to questions pertaining to them, along with training their chatbot to their liking.
