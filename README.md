# Project Description
I am working on a simple Python Artificially Intelligent ChatBot project to take standard user input from the user, store it to a "knowledge base" (in this project a txt file), and ensure no case or type sensitive issues cause faulty output results from it. Functionalities of this project will expand over time.
